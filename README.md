# RHEED Pattern Viewer 

This project aims to provide viewing and analysis capabilities for RHEED patterns displayed
on an MBE chamber. Patterns are captured on a Basler camera and displayed using OpenCV. 
Rectangular regions may be selected, allowing for their intensities to be monitored over a 
period of time (useful for time-resolved RHEED analysis). 

While intended for RHEED patterns, this software is extensible and may be easily repurposed 
for use with any camera, and analysis of any image.
